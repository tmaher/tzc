Included here are a few different versions of the emacs zephyr setup.

The version of choice is 'lounge-zephyr-setup.el,' so that is the what
these instructions will help you run.

To run xemacs in zephyr mode, there are 3 steps:

1) add the following to you ~/.xemacs/init.el:

(setq load-path (append (list                                                   
                         "/usr/share/tzc")                                      
                         load-path))                                            
                                                                                
(load "lounge-zephyr-setup.el")


2) copy /usr/share/tzc/zephyr-options.el to ~/.zephyr-options.el


3) edit ~/.zephyr-options.el and fill in your personal info


Then invoke xemacs as 'xemacs -f zephyr-dual' or run 
'M-x zephyr-dual' after you're already in emacs.
